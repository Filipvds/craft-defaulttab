# Default Tab for Craft CMS

When building sites with Craft CMS, you've probably done this a couple of times: you create a new section, you go to add fields and the first thing you have to do is add a news tab. Every time. This plugin aims to fix that ðŸŽ‰.

## Installation

To install Splashing Images, follow these steps:

1. Download & unzip the file and place the `defaulttab` directory into your `craft/plugins` directory
2. Install plugin in the Craft Control Panel under Settings > Plugins
3. The plugin folder should be named `defaulttab` for Craft to see it.  GitHub recently started appending `-master` (the branch name) to the name of the folder for zip file downloads.

Default Tab works on Craft 2.4.x, 2.5.x. and 2.6.x

## Configuration

Install the plugin and set a default title for your first tab. If you don't, the default title will be "Content". That's it. Enjoy.
